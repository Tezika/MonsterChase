## Introduction

### Rule 

Basically, This game is a **2D Pong**. And there are two players who can control the bat to hit the ball.  The aim for this game is to get the ball touch the wall(**red wall**) behind the other player.

### Control

* One player uses the `W`,`S` to move the bat : `W` for move up, 'S' for move down.
* The other player uses the `O`,`K` to move the bat:  `O` for move up, `K` for move down.
* Press the `Space Bar` to start the game any time.

### Game Flow

`Enter the Game` -> `Idle State`->`Press 'Space Bar' to start the game` -> `Once the ball touches the left or right wall` -> `Idle State`.

PS: When you press the `Space Bar` any time in the game, it will restart the game manually.
